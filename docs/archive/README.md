# Archive

This directory contains historical/working documents from the framework's development process.

## Contents

### Development Working Documents
- **claude-code-patterns-analysis.md** - Analysis of Claude Code patterns during framework design
- **external-sources-synthesis.md** - Research synthesis from external sources (Superpowers, Contains Studio)
- **TEST_REPORT.md** - Validation results from initial testing phase

### Historical Documentation
- **SESSION_STATE.md** - Running project logbook used during initial development (Nov 2025)
  - Contains detailed development history and progress
  - Superseded by the new auto-documentation system (PROJECT_OVERVIEW, CURRENT_TASK, ROADMAP)
  - Preserved for historical reference

## Why Archive These?

These documents were valuable during development but would clutter the main documentation. They're preserved here for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding the development process
- Learning about design decisions
- Avoiding duplicate research

## Current Documentation

For current project documentation, see:
- `/docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Current project status
- `/docs/CURRENT_TASK.md` - Active work tracking
- `/docs/ROADMAP.md` - Work planning
- `/docs/AUTO_DOCS_GUIDE.md` - Auto-documentation system guide
