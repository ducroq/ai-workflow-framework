## Important (Affects Design)
- [ ] **Should hooks invoke agents directly or use external scripts?** - Current hooks are bash scripts with TODOs to invoke agents. Need to decide on implementation pattern.
- [ ] **How should users customize which hooks are active?** - Some users may want different automation levels (full auto vs suggestions only)

## Nice to Know (Can Work Around)
- [ ] **Should we support multiple documentation styles?** - Some teams prefer different doc structures (ADRs vs RFCs, different templates)
