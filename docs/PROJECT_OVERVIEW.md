# Project Overview

## Vision
Build a reusable AI-augmented workflow framework with agents, skills, hooks, and auto-documentation that enables zero-friction AI-assisted development across multiple domains (software engineering, ML workflows, data science, security, DevOps).

## Current Status
**Phase:** Production Ready + Expansion
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-15

The framework core is production-ready with 11 operational agents across 5 domains. Now implementing the auto-documentation system from the foundation document to make the framework self-documenting and provide this capability to projects using the framework.

## Active Focus Areas
- [x] Implement full auto-documentation system
- [ ] Test and validate auto-docs in real usage
- [ ] Document auto-docs for end users
- [ ] Prepare for wider distribution

## Recent Significant Decisions
- 2025-11-15: Implemented full auto-documentation system (not just suggestions) → Enables projects to have living documentation
- 2025-11-15: Added foundational AI_AUGMENTED_SOLO_DEV_FRAMEWORK.md → Provides philosophical basis
