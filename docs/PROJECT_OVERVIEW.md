# Project Overview

## Vision
Build a reusable AI-augmented workflow framework with agents, skills, hooks, auto-documentation, and structured feature workflows that enables zero-friction AI-assisted development across multiple domains (software engineering, ML workflows, data science, security, DevOps).

## Current Status
**Phase:** Production Ready + Active Use
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-17

The framework is production-ready with 13+ agents across 5 domains, complete auto-documentation system, and a new TDD-based feature workflow system with persona-based slash commands.

## Active Focus Areas
- [x] Implement full auto-documentation system
- [x] Create feature workflow system (TDD with personas)
- [x] Test workflow with real example (F001 Dark Mode Toggle)
- [ ] Validate in real-world projects
- [ ] Prepare for wider distribution

## Recent Significant Decisions
- 2025-11-17: **Implemented Feature Workflow System** → Structured TDD workflow with 6 personas (PM, Architect, Test Eng, Impl Eng, QA, Doc Writer)
- 2025-11-17: **Fixed hooks configuration** → Updated to Claude Code 2.0+ format
- 2025-11-15: Implemented full auto-documentation system → Enables projects to have living documentation
- 2025-11-15: Added foundational AI_AUGMENTED_SOLO_DEV_FRAMEWORK.md → Provides philosophical basis
