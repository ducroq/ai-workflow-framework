### Feature Workflow System Testing
**Status**: Done (2025-12-02)

**What was achieved**:
- Validated TDD-based feature workflow with F001 Dark Mode Toggle demo
- Tested persona-based slash commands (/architect, /test-first, /implement)
- Fixed hook configuration issues (Stop hooks, visibility)
- F001 archived to `docs/archive/F001-dark-mode-toggle/`

**Key learnings**:
- User-level settings (~/.claude/settings.json) override project settings
- Hooks need ASCII output for Windows compatibility
- Demo features should be scoped minimally to validate workflow
