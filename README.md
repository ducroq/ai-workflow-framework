## What is Conductor?

**Conductor** is a production-ready framework for creating, managing, and deploying specialized AI agents across multiple domains. Think of it as an orchestration layer for AI-augmented workflows - systematizing how you leverage Claude Code for complex cognitive tasks.

**Purpose**: Reusable agent and skill infrastructure for software engineering, ML workflows, data science, DevOps, security, and beyond.

---

## Overview

This framework provides a complete system for creating, managing, and using specialized AI agents and skills across multiple domains (software engineering, ML workflows, testing, etc.).

**Key Features**:
- **Meta-templates** for consistent agent/skill creation
- **Metaskills** that create and test other agents (self-improving)
- **Domain-based organization** for scalability
- **Mandatory skills** (auto-invoked when applicable)
- **PASS/REVIEW/FAIL decision framework**
- **Persuasion-informed design** (authority, commitment, social proof)
- **Pressure testing** methodology

### 2. Using Existing Agents

**Invoke code-reviewer**:
```
You: "Review this authentication logic for security vulnerabilities"

Claude: [Reads .claude/agents/software-engineering/code-reviewer.md]
Claude: [Performs systematic security review using OWASP Top 10]
Claude: [Returns PASS/REVIEW/FAIL with specific findings]
```

**Invoke oracle-calibration**:
```
You: "Calibrate the LLM for sentiment scoring before labeling 10k articles"

Claude: [Reads .claude/agents/ml-workflow/oracle-calibration.md]
Claude: [Samples 200 articles, runs calibration, analyzes distributions]
Claude: [Provides PASS/REVIEW/FAIL recommendation with cost estimates]
```

### 3. Using Skills (Auto-Invoked)

**Skills activate automatically** when Claude detects applicable scenarios:

```
You: "This function is 50 lines long and hard to read"

Claude: [Automatically invokes refactor-extract-function skill]
Claude: [Identifies code blocks to extract]
Claude: [Performs extraction with before/after examples]
```

**Note**: Skills are marked `when_mandatory: true` - Claude MUST use them when applicable.

### 4. Creating New Agents

**Use agent-creator metaskill**:

```
You: "Create an agent for database migration validation"

Claude: [Reads .claude/agents/meta/agent-creator.md]
Claude: [Reads AGENT-TEMPLATE.md]
Claude: [Researches database migration best practices]
Claude: [Fills template with comprehensive content]
Claude: [Saves to .claude/agents/software-engineering/database-migration-validator.md]
Claude: [Invokes agent-tester to pressure-test the new agent]
Claude: "✅ Agent created and tested. Ready for use."
```

### 5. Creating New Skills

**Use skill-creator metaskill**:

```
You: "Create a skill for generating Jest unit tests"

Claude: [Reads .claude/agents/meta/skill-creator.md]
Claude: [Reads SKILL-TEMPLATE.md]
Claude: [Defines triggers, process steps, examples]
Claude: [Saves to .claude/skills/software-engineering/test-generator-jest.md]
Claude: "✅ Skill created. Will auto-invoke when new functions are created."
```

### 6. Pressure Testing Agents

**Use agent-tester metaskill**:

```
You: "Pressure-test the code-reviewer agent under time pressure"

Claude: [Reads .claude/agents/meta/agent-tester.md]
Claude: [Simulates production outage scenario]
Claude: [Tests if agent maintains security checks despite urgency]
Claude: [Generates test report with PASS/REVIEW/FAIL]
```

## Key Concepts

### 1. Agents vs Skills

| Aspect | Agents | Skills |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Invocation** | Explicit (user asks) | Automatic (Claude decides) |
| **Scope** | Complex multi-step tasks | Focused single capabilities |
| **Example** | "Review this PR for security" | "Extract this function" |
| **Storage** | `.claude/agents/{domain}/` | `.claude/skills/{domain}/` |

### 2. Mandatory Skills

When a skill exists for a task, **Claude MUST use it**:

```yaml
when_mandatory: true  # Enforces usage when applicable
```

**Philosophy**: Skills codify best practices. Once created, they become mandatory to ensure consistency.

### 3. PASS/REVIEW/FAIL Framework

All agents use this decision framework:

- ✅ **PASS**: Criteria met, proceed
- ⚠️ **REVIEW**: Concerns but not blocking
- ❌ **FAIL**: Critical issues, block

**Example** (code-reviewer):
- PASS: No critical security issues
- REVIEW: Medium security concerns
- FAIL: SQL injection vulnerability detected

### 4. Persuasion Framework

All agents implement Cialdini's principles:

1. **Authority**: "I am the designated security reviewer"
2. **Commitment**: "By requesting review, you've committed to addressing issues"
3. **Social Proof**: "Top engineering teams use systematic code review"
4. **Consistency**: "Every code change undergoes rigorous review"

**Purpose**: Ensures agents actually follow best practices under pressure (not just acknowledge them).

### 5. Pressure Testing

**agent-tester** validates agents under realistic constraints:

- **Time Pressure**: Production outages, tight deadlines
- **Sunk Cost**: User invested significant time in approach
- **Authority**: Senior developer approved the code
- **Incomplete Info**: Missing requirements

**Philosophy**: Agents must maintain standards even when users resist.

### 6. Progressive Disclosure

Load context only when needed:

1. **Start broad**: Read SESSION_STATE.md, agent spec
2. **Navigate**: Find relevant domain/component
3. **Load specific**: Read only necessary code/data
4. **Total**: 10k tokens vs 100k+ for full codebase

2. Claude:
   - Invokes code-reviewer agent
   - Reads PR files
   - Automatically invokes security-scan-sql-injection skill (if SQL code present)
   - Automatically invokes refactor-extract-function skill (if long methods found)
   - Returns comprehensive review with PASS/REVIEW/FAIL

3. If FAIL:
   - User fixes issues
   - Requests re-review
   - Claude re-invokes code-reviewer

4. If PASS:
   - User merges PR
```

### Example 2: ML Pipeline Workflow

```
1. User: "I want to train a sentiment analysis model"

2. Claude:
   - Suggests: "First, let's calibrate the LLM for labeling"
   - Invokes oracle-calibration agent
   - Runs calibration on 200-sample dataset
   - Returns PASS/REVIEW/FAIL with cost estimates

3. If PASS:
   - User: "Proceed with full batch labeling"
   - Claude: Runs batch labeling (10k samples)
   - After labeling: Invokes dataset-qa agent
   - Validates dataset quality

4. If dataset-qa PASS:
   - User: "Train the model"
   - Claude: Invokes training-advisor agent
   - Recommends hyperparameters, strategy
```

### Example 3: Creating New Capabilities

```
1. User: "I need an agent for API versioning strategy"

2. Claude:
   - Invokes agent-creator metaskill
   - Reads AGENT-TEMPLATE.md
   - Researches API versioning best practices
   - Generates comprehensive agent spec
   - Saves to .claude/agents/software-engineering/api-versioning-advisor.md
   - Invokes agent-tester to pressure-test

3. agent-tester:
   - Tests under time pressure

## Extending the Framework

### Adding New Domains

1. Create directory: `.claude/agents/{new-domain}/`
2. Create directory: `.claude/skills/{new-domain}/`
3. Update `docs/TAXONOMY.md` with new domain
4. Use agent-creator to generate domain-specific agents
5. Use skill-creator to generate domain-specific skills

**Example Domains**:
- `data-science` (analysis, visualization)
- `devops` (infrastructure, monitoring)
- `security` (pentesting, compliance)
- `documentation` (technical writing)

### Migrating Existing Custom Agents

**If you have existing agent specifications**:
1. Read your existing agent definition
2. Use agent-creator to convert to Conductor format
3. Save to appropriate domain directory
4. Test with agent-tester to validate quality

**Benefits of migration**:
- Consistent YAML frontmatter structure
- PASS/REVIEW/FAIL decision framework
- Pressure-tested under realistic constraints
- Integration with Conductor's hook and MCP systems

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Start with metaskills**: Use agent-creator/skill-creator to generate new capabilities
2. **Pressure-test before deployment**: Always run agent-tester on new agents
3. **Keep SESSION_STATE.md updated**: Document progress for context recovery
4. **Use progressive disclosure**: Don't load entire codebase, navigate incrementally
5. **Trust mandatory skills**: If a skill exists, let Claude use it automatically

### For Agent Creators

1. **Include 3-4 concrete examples**: Generic examples reduce usability
2. **Define clear triggers**: "When to use" AND "When NOT to use"
3. **Make decision criteria testable**: Use measurable conditions, not subjective
4. **Implement persuasion framework**: Authority, commitment, social proof, consistency
5. **Document anti-patterns**: Explicitly call out what NOT to do
6. **Minimize tool permissions**: Grant only necessary tools (principle of least privilege)

### For Skill Creators

1. **Single responsibility**: One capability per skill (not multi-function)
2. **Detailed process steps**: Claude needs step-by-step instructions
3. **Before/after code examples**: Show concrete transformations
4. **Quality checks**: Define measurable success criteria
5. **Mark as mandatory**: Set `when_mandatory: true` for established patterns
